the following commands are useful for artists who need to flip their work often or would like to turn the drawing as they work.

flip_horizontal - flip everything on the stage horizontally
rotate_right_15deg - rotate everything on the stage clockwise 15 degrees
rotate_left_15deg   - rotate everything on the stage counterclockwise 15 degrees
